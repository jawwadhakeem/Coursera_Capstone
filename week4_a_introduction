Introduction / Business Problem

Individuals and families migrate to different cities across the globe for multifarious reasons. Some migrate to join families, and some migrate to find better livelihood. Not much research goes into picking a place other than what is evident, on the table. Not to mention, family-members / friends experiences are relied upon the most. 

With data science based factual research in place, one is able to take decisions on quantifiable basis. I’d like to use this approach to show how one can pick a place similar to their current habitat. This will be useful for all who are looking to change their existing address with a new one.

I will be using the foursquare API to compare different localities – their neighborhoods and available amenities – to establish the best option for migration.
